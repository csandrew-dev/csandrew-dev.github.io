# My Experience at [PSU MacAdmins](https://macadmins.psu.edu/)

### Thank you MacAdmins Foundation
Let me get a Thank You out first. I was an awardee of the 2025 Community and Conference Grant from the [MacAdmins Foundation](https://www.macadmins.org/) which is the only reason I was able to go to the Conference so THANK YOU for the opportunity.

### First Time? ~~"No, not my first time"~~ yes, my first time
This was my first time going to this conference and really any conference. What a wonderful experience. The community was great, the talks were awesome, and there was so much to do and learn.

I'm not sure what I expected, but attending as a person in a tier 2 support role and not being a full "MacAdmin", I thought lots of information was going to go over my head or not be applicable to me because I'm not in a role matching the speaker, but talks were digestible and people I talked to understood I didn't know everything but wanted to eagerly learn. Also a heavy dose of imposter syndrome because I don't want to sound like a fool in front of people that I have tons of respect for.

### What the heck did I do?
Well my favorite event of them all was Nate Walck's [NanoMDM](https://micromdm.io/blog/introducing-nanomdm/) hack-a-thon. Since the first time I heard about MDMs I instantly searched for free and/or open source to experiment with. Then I found about Apple Developer "roadblock" and my excitment dipped. I have since literally paid the fiddler so I can run an MDM @home (watch for a future blog post). Anyways, this workshop was by far my favorite because it gave me the confidence & inspiration to play with Nano and MDM/DDM. I also got to meet some great people, talk and ask questions in depth about topics/processes I didn't understand more than asking a question at the end of talk in a big room.

The talk recordings are almost live so go to [macadmins.psu.edu/conference/resources/](https://macadmins.psu.edu/conference/resources/) to check them out. 

Here are my recommendations:
- William Smith's Scripting FUNdamentals for Mac admins
    - Very good for people new to general scripting and programming concepts, a bit slow for my liking but still got a lot of good information out of it.
    - Talkingmoose (William) is a great teacher and speaker.
- Greg Neagle's A Brief History of Password Syncing
    - So much information and "lore" packed into this one.
    - I had no idea about most of things that happened in the past so getting background on way modern day processes are the way they are was very eye opening.
- Jacob Burley's Automate all the things â€“ fully automated OS and App patching
    - Fascinating to see how Jacob is able to improve processes and automate things that seems daunting to automate.
- Beth Johnson's swiftDialog for Overworked Mac Admins
    - Great introduction to swiftDialog with lots of tips of different flags to use that even seasoned admins that use swiftDialog didn't know about.
- Kevin Cox's MDM Migration Demystified: Best Practices for macOS Admins
    - Kevin has done maybe 3 MDM migration so I think thats more than most and he knows a thing or two.
    - I mean c'mon its Kevin, also got PSU Ice Cream with him ðŸ˜„
- Ross Matsuda's The Day After â€“ Post-Installation Visibility Through Scripting
    - So many tips about how to improve script viability by being about to pull out information from packages

You really should just watch them all when they come out.

### Summary
- Would I go again? Duh
Catch me next year hopefully giving a talk.

I appreciate all the work the organizing committee at PSU did to run this event. It has really helped me figure out what I want to do and how to achieve that.
