# Fun Linux/Unix Tasks and Commands

Just a little context, this is a modified version of an assignment for my software security class so we are using the [Seed Labs VM](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/) so if you want to follow along, set that up on your machine. 

# Task 1:

## Item 1: Enable ssh

ssh is already enabled on the base vm.

### Command:

`ssh seed@seedvm.local.lan`  

This connects to the vm via ssh, command {use}@{host} and  

`systemctl status sshd`

This asks the OS ‚Äúwhat is the status of the sshd service?‚Äù

### Output:

![](../../unix-fun/task1.1(2).png#center)

## Item 2: Enable SFTP

sftp is already enabled on the base vm.

### Command:

`sftp seed@seedvm.local.lan`   

this connects to the vm using sftp, so command {user}@{host} and

`ps aux | grep sftp`  

lists all running processes and filters the output to show only those related to sftp, helping check if an SFTP process is running

### Output:

![](../../unix-fun/task1.2.png#center)

![](../../unix-fun/task1.1(2).png#center)

# Task 2:

## Item 1:download

Couldn‚Äôt use wget or curl, so had to download through my class canvas page üòì.

## Item 2: copy the tarballs into ~/Documents

### Command:

`stfp> put hw1.*.tar.gz /home/seed/Documents/`  

Put is the command to move a file from local to remote and then the name of the local file, * to denote any hw1. file and then the location on the remote.

### `Output:`

![](../../unix-fun/task2.2.png#center)

## Item 3: decompress the tarballs

### Command:

`for f in *.gz; do tar -xvf ‚Äú$f‚Äù; done`

Loop through files ending in .gz and run the command ‚Äútar -xvf {file}‚Äù until the loop finishes.

### Output:

![](../../unix-fun/task2.3.png#center)

![](../../unix-fun/task2.3(2).png#center)

# Task 3:

## Item 1: List the contents of the "hw1.1" directory using the "ls" command

### Command:

`ls -latrh`  

ls, list command, -l is long listing, -a is show all files(show hidden), -tr is sort by time and then reverse, finally -h is human readable for the size of files.

### Output:

![](../../unix-fun/task3.1.png#center)
![](../../unix-fun/task3.1(2).png#center)

## Item 2: Run the following command "cat /usr/share/dict/words | grep -i hello > /tmp/words.log"

### Explanation:

This command is using the cat command to display the contents of /usr/share/dict/words to stdout but the ‚Äú|‚Äù redirects this output to the input for the grep command, the -i is to have grep ignore the casing of the letters in the file, ‚Äúhello‚Äù is the string we are searching for with grep, the ‚Äú>‚Äù means we are going to write this output to a file, in this case /tmp/words.log.

### Output:

![](../../unix-fun/task3.2.png#center)

## Item 3: Copy the file numbers.txt from the current directory to the java subdirectory

### Command:

`cp numbers.txt ./java/`  

Cp command is copy and then SOURCE DEST, in this case numbers.txt is in the current directory so just put the file name. Then DEST is ./java/ to show . is current directory and java/ shows it is a directory and then nothing after the last / means keep the file named numbers.txt

### Output:

![](../../unix-fun/task3.3.png#center)

## Item 4: Rename the file Burrot.java to Borat.java

### Command:

`mv Burrot.java Borat.java`  

mv command to ‚Äúmove‚Äù the file from Burrot.java to Borat.java, in this case renaming it.

### Output:

![](../../unix-fun/task3.4.png#center)

## Item 5: Delete the files diff.html and diff.css

### Command:

`rm diff.*`  

Remove files with the start of ‚Äúdiff.‚Äù and the * the is a wildcard to remove any file type matching ‚Äúdiff.‚Äù

### Output:

![](../../unix-fun/task3.5.png#center)

## Item 6: List all web page files (files whose names end with the extension .html or .css) in the current directory.

### Command:

`ls -- *html *.css`  

List the -- is a shorthand for name of file. Then *.html looks for any files html files and *.css looks for any css files.

### Output:

![](../../unix-fun/task3.6.png#center)

## Item 7: Copy all the text files (files whose names end with .txt) from the current folder to the website subdirectory

### Command:

`cp *.txt ./website/`  

Copy any files with the ending .txt to the . current directory website directory.

### Output:

![](../../unix-fun/task3.7.png#center)

## Item 8: Display the contents of all files whose names begin with verse and end with the extension .txt

### Command:

`cat verse*.txt`  

Cat to display the contents of files. Then verse is the start of the file and * to match anything after and then .txt to match the ending of the file.

### Output:

![](../../unix-fun/task3.8.png#center)

# Task 4:

## Item 1:

### Command:

`sort -u animals2.txt | head -n 16`  

sort command, -u for uniqname removes duplicates, animals2.txt is the file put in an argument, piped to head -n 16 to show the first 16 items out the output.

### Output:

![](../../unix-fun/task4.1.png#center)

## Item 2: Combine the contents of files verse1.txt, verse2.txt, and verse3.txt into a new file lyrics.txt

### Command:

`cat verse*.txt > lyrics.txt`  

cat all files that match verse(wildcard).txt and write that to lyrics.txt

### Output:

![](../../unix-fun/task4.2.png#center)

## Item 3: Display all lines from animals.txt that contain the word "growl" ignoring case, in reverse-ABC-sorted order and with no duplicates. Output the lines themselves only.

### Command:

`sort -ur animals.txt | grep -i growl`  

sort -ur to sort animals by unique and in reverse order, pipe that output to grep -i to ignore case of target string ‚Äúgrowl‚Äù

### Output:

![](../../unix-fun/task4.3.png#center)

# Task 5:

## Item 1: Set the file example1.txt in the current directory so that its group and other can write to the file.

### Command:

`chmod go+w example1.txt`  

Change modification of g (group) and o (other) + adds w (write) permission to the example1.txt

### Output:

![](../../unix-fun/task5.1.png#center)

## Item 2: Set all files with extensions .dat and .doc to be read/writable (but not executable) by their owner, and to have no access from others.

### Command:

If you know the current permissions:

`chmod go-r *.dat *.doc`

Chmod g(roup) o(other) - (remove) r(ead permissions)

If you don‚Äôt know the current permissions:

`chmod u=rw,go= *.dat *.doc`  

Chmod u(ser) set to r(ead)w(rite), g(roup)o(other) set to nothing on all dat and doc files.

### Output:

![](../../unix-fun/task5.2.png#center)
![](../../unix-fun/task5.2(2).png#center)

## Item 3: How many users exist on this Linux system that use the Bash shell by default?

### Command:

`grep ‚Äú/bin/bash‚Äù /etc/passwd | wc -l`  

grep for string ‚Äú/bin/bash‚Äù in the passwd file, pipe that output to wc (word count) and -l is for newline count.

### Output:

![](../../unix-fun/task5.3.png#center)

## Item 4: Create a file foo.txt using the ‚Äútouch‚Äù command. Change the file's last-modified date to be January 4 of this year at 8:56am

### Command:

`touch -t 01040856 foo.txt`  

touch -t to set time modified and then 01 is for January, 04 is for the 4th of January, 08 is for 8am, and 56 is for 8:56am, foo.txt is the name of the file.

### Output:

# Conclusion:

I very much enjoyed this assignment. I took an Intro to Linux class at my local community college while I was in high school and this took me right back there. I think having the ability to work quickly in the command line is a great skill to have. My recommendation is that people take a look at these two websites/talks/courses if they are interested in the same topics:

* [https://missing.csail.mit.edu/](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)   
* [awk sed grep slides](https://bpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.psu.edu/dist/4/24696/files/2024/07/psumac2024-Awk-sed-grep-Together-we-can-change-anything-compressed.pdf) and [awk sed grep talk video](https://youtu.be/axmDzoUov_8)

As you may be able to tell I‚Äôm very interested in the ‚Äúpoweruser‚Äù type of things so this was a nice exercise. I think so far these topics and skills is something that all computer science students should have within in their first or second year.
