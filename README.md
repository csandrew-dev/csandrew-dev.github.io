# Andrew's Site

First, thank you for visting my site or rather the github repository for my site. This site will be continually updated with new information as time goes on but for now, it is a place for me to display myself and show what I am up to. 
The goal of the site is to provide a place on the internet for me to share my thoughts and projects, generally related to my software projects, but not limited to only software and computing related ideas. In the future I hope to add 
a blog of sorts to share my knowledge and teach/inspire people to be interested in my hobbies, like self-hosting, FOSS/GNU software, and general computer topics. Yes, I know pretty nerdy, but you are on Github after all. 

Anyways, feel free to browse the site and connect with me if you find anything interesting that you would like to talk about. I am always up for it. If you find a mistake, submit an issue or PR. Thanks for spending some of your precious time here, 
with me.
