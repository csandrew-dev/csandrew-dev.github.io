                <p>
                    I am a student-athlete at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. 
                    I am earning a Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance. 
                    My hobbies include playing soccer, FOSS/self-hosted software, and hanging out with friends.
                    Currently, I work as a service desk technician, but want to move into network engineering or IT infastucture.

                        Noter. A full stack web app built with the MERN stack. 
                        I developed this for a course final project. It is a simple note taking app that allows plain text or, my prefence, <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/" target="_blank">markdown</a>. 
                        They are stored as notes and notebooks. You create a note and then can add it to a notebook and then select a notebook and view your notes in rendered markdown and export it as a pdf.
                        I learned about <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">mongodb</a> clusters and relational databases. 
                        I learned a lot about HTTP requests and how to tranlate them from front to back to database. The app 
                        had to have CRUD or SCRUD functionality, which I implemented in simple ways with create, delete, and update buttons. 
                        Then I added "search" through a filtering system with the notebooks. This was also my first time using Node. I had 
                        heard of it before, and npm, but never used it. I learned how to use npm to install packages and how to use Node to 
                        run a sever. You can find the code for this project on my github.

                    <div class="project">NSM. A automation for starting and safely exposing a minecraft game server for my friends and myself. 
                        This project was a lot of fun to work on. It used linux daemons, bash scripts, and some python. Basically, how it worked 
                        was I would turn on my server and that had a daemon running on it to start two scripts. One script was the python 
                        script that start the <a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">discord bot</a> and the other was a bash script that started the minecraft server. The discord bot then 
                        a tunneling service called <a href="https://ngrok.com/" target="_blank">ngrok</a> to create a tcp tunnel to the minecraft server. The bot would send a message into a dedicated 
                        channel with the ngrok url. Then, the user would copy the url and paste it into their minecraft client. This would allow them 
                        to connect to the server. The bot also had a command to stop the server and the bot. This was a fun project because I got to 
                        learn about daemons and how to use them. I also learned about ngrok and how to use it. I also learned about how to use discord 
                        bots and how to use the discord api. You can find the code for this project on my github. Sadly this project no longer works 
                        because ngrok changed their free tier to not allow tcp tunnels.

                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank">Free and Open Source Software</a> is a huge 
                        hobby for me. I run lots of FOSS on my computer and on my servers. I have a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry pi</a> 
                        that I have used to run <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/" target="_blank">RetroPie</a>, <a href="https://pi-hole.net/" target="_blank">PiHole</a>, 
                        and the Unifi Controller software for my <a href="https://ui.com/introduction" target="_blank">Unifi</a>/<a href="https://www.pfsense.org/" target="_blank">PFsense</a> network. 
                        I have plans to expand to run other services like <a href="https://jellyfin.org/" target="_blank">Jellyfin</a>, <a href="https://nextcloud.com/" target="_blank">Nextcloud</a>, 
                        and more through a hypervisor, like <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/" target="_blank">Proxmox</a> or <a href="https://xcp-ng.org/" target="_blank">XCP-ng</a>, or just <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">docker containers</a> 
                        with <a href="https://www.portainer.io/" target="_blank">portainer</a> or something. Back to my network, my dad and I retrofitted our house with cat6 cabling and unifi APs. 
                        I have a small 1u Supermicro server running PFsense as my firewall/router. Then to connect everything I have 2 small 8 port unifi switches and a 24 port unifi switch. 
                        I configured the network to use a link aggregation uplink the router to the main switch, ironically called "LAGGy lan". I just did the basic configuration for the wireless network. 
                        In the future I want to configure vlans and other things. I do all this because I am interested in system administration and networking. 
                        So building and maintaining my own network is a great way to learn. I also do it because I like to have control over my network and my data.
